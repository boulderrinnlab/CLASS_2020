# Expression vs. DNA-binding at promoters

#### Purpose: Compare expression of genes to binding in promoter regions
 
This script extracts expression counts from K562 RNA-seq data and identifies 
DNA-binding events at promoters from the K562 ChIP-seq consensus peak dataset. 
We have included further analysis on promoters that contain â‰¥7 DNA-binding 
events but are not expressed.


### Source for RNA-seq data

total RNA-seq for K562 dataset: 
https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR885DVH/

### Analysis of RNA-seq data

Loading in the RNAseq data and converting to TPM and saving as CSV of TPM values

```{r read_counts_to_TPM}
if (!file.exists("results/k562_tpm.csv")) {
  
  fl <- list.files("data/", pattern = ".bam", full.names = T)
  if (length(fl < 2)) {
    system("cd data;
           wget https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF625ZBS/@@download/ENCFF625ZBS.bam",
           intern = FALSE, ignore.stdout = TRUE, ignore.stderr = TRUE)
    system("cd data;
           wget https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF630HEX/@@download/ENCFF630HEX.bam",
           intern = FALSE, ignore.stdout = TRUE, ignore.stderr = TRUE)
  }
  
  counts <- featureCounts(c("data/ENCFF625ZBS.bam", "data/ENCFF630HEX.bam"),
                          annot.ext = "../../../genomes/human/gencode/v32/gencode.v32.annotation.gtf",
                          isGTFAnnotationFile = T,
                          isPairedEnd = TRUE,
                          nthreads = 16)
  
  rpk <- counts$counts / (counts$annotation$Length/1000)
  expression <- data.frame("rpk" = rpk) %>%
    rownames_to_column("gene_id") %>%
    pivot_longer(2:3, names_to = "sample", values_to = "rpk")
  
  expression_summary <- expression %>%
    group_by(sample) %>%
    summarize(total_rpk = sum(rpk, na.rm = T))
  expression_summary$rpk_m <- expression_summary$total_rpk / 1e6
  expression <- merge(expression, expression_summary)
  expression$tpm <- expression$rpk / expression$rpk_m
  tpm <- expression %>% group_by(gene_id) %>%
    summarize(tpm = mean(tpm, na.rm = T))
  write_csv(tpm, "results/k562_tpm.csv")
}
tpm <- read.csv("results/k562_tpm.csv")
```


Let's add the expression data to our peak_occurence_df generated 
in 01_consensus_peaks.
Our strategy will be to keep adding variables to our observations (promoters). 
We can then plot from this data frame as it grows. 

```{r import}
base_path <- "../01_consensus_peaks/results/"
peak_occurrence_df <- read.csv(file.path(base_path,
                                         "peak_occurence_dataframe.csv"))
peak_occurrence_matrix <- read.table(file.path(base_path,
                                         "lncrna_mrna_promoter_peak_occurence_matrix.tsv"))
# TODO WHERE IS THIS FILE WRITTEN OUT??
expression_occurrence_df <- read.csv("results/peak_tpm_occurence_df.csv")
peak_occurrence_df <- merge(peak_occurrence_df, expression_occurrence_df)
#filtering out an old column used to be called number_tfs is now number_of_dbp.
peak_occurrence_df <- peak_occurrence_df %>% dplyr::select(-number_of_tfs)
```

#### Plotting binding of lncRNAs and mRNAs versus expression

We see an upward trend in both lncRNA and mRNA promoters between number of binding events and expression output

g <- ggplot(peak_occurrence_df, 
            aes(y = log2(tpm + 0.001), x = number_of_dbp, color = gene_type))

Here we will plot the binding events as a funciton of off, low,
medium and high expression We find that at off and low expressed promoters 
there is no difference in binding events 
(including hundreds at a single promoter) between lncRNA and mRNA promoters.

```{r binned-by-expression, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## let's try a binned approach
quantile(peak_occurrence_df$tpm)
peak_occurrence_df$expression <- cut(peak_occurrence_df$tpm, 
                                     breaks = c(-1, 0.001, 0.137, 3, 5000),
                                    labels = c("off", "low", "med", "high"))

levels(cut(peak_occurrence_df$tpm, breaks = c(-1, 0.001, 0.137, 3, 5000)))
