# Purpose: Create consensus peak sets
# Here we'd just like to take the replicate files per TF and create one peak set per TF with the subset of peaks that had an 
# overlapping peak in all replicates. 

```{r}

consensus_peaks <- create_consensus_peaks(broadpeakfilepath = "/Shares/rinn_class/data/k562_chip/results/bwa/mergedLibrary/macs/broadPeak")

num_peaks <- sapply(consensus_peaks, length)


# We're going toconsensus_peaks apply a cutoff at 250 peaks
consensus_peaks <- consensus_peaks[num_peaks > 250]


# Export the peak lists.
for(i in 1:length(consensus_peaks)) {
  rtracklayer::export(consensus_peaks[[i]], paste0("results/", names(consensus_peaks)[i], "_consensus_peaks.bed"))
}

```

```{r}


fl <- list.files("results/", full.names = T)
peak_summary <- data.frame("TF" = character(),
                           "numpeaks" = numeric(), 
                           "peak_length" = numeric())
tfs <- sapply(fl, function(x) {
  unlist(strsplit(unlist(strsplit(x,"//"))[[2]], "_"))[[1]]
})
for(i in 1:length(fl)) {
peaks <- rtracklayer::import(fl[i], format = "bed")
num_peaks <- length(peaks)
peak_length <- sum(width(peaks))
peak_summary <- bind_rows(peak_summary,
                          data.frame("TF" =tfs[i],

#TODO Make a nice historgram or density plot
